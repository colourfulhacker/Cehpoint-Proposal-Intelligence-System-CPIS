1. Objective

Build a client portal where CEHPOINT clients can:

Create an account

Provide business information OR upload their business profile document

Receive automated service recommendations (later powered by Gemini)

View their personalized recommendations inside a clean, premium dashboard

Understand exactly why each service is relevant to their business

Request a meeting with CEHPOINT

This creates a consulting-like experience without manual sales intervention.

2. Two Ways to Provide Business Information

Clients must be given two options:

Option A — Upload Business Profile

They upload their company profile PDF, pitch deck, or any business document.

System extracts or stores the data for Gemini processing later.

Option B — Answer Structured Questions

The portal asks everything normally found inside a professional business profile.

Client answers these questions in a step-by-step flow.

Both options produce the same dataset.
