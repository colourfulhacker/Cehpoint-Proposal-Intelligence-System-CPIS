Final Plan: Cehpoint – AI-Powered Client Onboarding & Service Recommendation System (Using Gemini from Day One)
1. Core Purpose

Create a system where a client can either:

Upload their business profile, OR

Fill a structured questionnaire that captures everything normally found in a business profile.

This information goes to Gemini from day one, which analyses it and recommends:

IT services

Security services

Automation solutions

Software development ideas

Process improvement opportunities

Infrastructure/business workflow improvements

All recommendations must be high-quality, specific, actionable, and uniquely valuable for that client.

2. Client Onboarding Flow
Step 1: Sign Up

Client completes a simple sign-up.
After login, they land on the Discovery Page.

3. Discovery Page (Business Profile Collection)

Client sees two clear options:

Option A — Upload Business Profile

Allowed file types:

PDF

DOCX

TXT

Website URL

This profile is parsed and sent to Gemini.

Option B — Fill “Smart Business Profile Questionnaire”

This questionnaire captures everything that businesses typically put into their corporate profile.

4. Smart Business Profile Questionnaire (Final List)

This is the final set of questions—these are the ONLY details you need to collect from the client.
All are designed so Gemini can produce high-precision recommendations.
