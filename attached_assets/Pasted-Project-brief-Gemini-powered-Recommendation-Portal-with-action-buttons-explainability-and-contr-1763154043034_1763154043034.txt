Project brief — Gemini-powered Recommendation Portal (with action buttons, explainability, and controversy-risk controls)

Below is a concise, developer-ready concept-level plan you can share. It focuses on: clear client action buttons (so clients can inspect why a recommendation was made), strong safeguards to reduce disputes, and design choices that minimize operational, legal, and ethical loopholes. I won’t include deep technical specs — just behavior, UI elements, data to collect, and governance/UX rules your team must follow to keep this robust and defensible.

1) High-level product idea (one-line)

An AI (Gemini) driven portal that accepts client business inputs, generates prioritized IT & cybersecurity recommendations, and offers interactive buttons so clients can inspect the evidence, challenge suggestions, or instantly book a meeting — while preserving full auditability, transparency, and legal/privacy controls to minimize disputes.

2) Key user-facing buttons (and what they do)

Place these next to each recommended item (and also globally for the full report).

Why this for you — short human-readable rationale (1–2 sentences).

Show evidence — shows the input fields, relevant extracted facts, and any internal reasoning snippets (structured), plus the Gemini response block and the confidence score.

View risks if ignored — concrete business/financial/operational impact statements and examples.

View alternative options — lower-cost or phased alternatives and estimated pros/cons.

Request change / Flag — client can mark the recommendation as incorrect or incomplete and submit a reason; creates a ticket for human review.

Book meeting — calendar picker + suggested times; attaches the full report and client questions automatically.

Download proposal (PDF) — auto-generated proposal with timestamp, version number, and signature area.

Share with colleague — email/share link with access controls and expiry.

Disagree (appeal) — structured form for formal dispute that triggers escalation to senior analyst with SLA.

Button UI rules

Buttons must be visible but not aggressive—use clear wording and short microcopy explaining what clicking will do.

Each button click must be recorded in the audit log with user id, timestamp, and payload viewed.

3) Information to collect (to make Gemini outputs explainable and defensible)

Collect rich, structured fields — required items first, optional later.

A. Identity & contact (required)

Company name, industry, website, primary contact name, role, email, phone.

B. Business scale & scope (required)

No. employees, revenue band (range), number of locations/branches, customer types (B2B/B2C).

C. IT & data facts (required)

Hosting type and provider, tech stack (web/mobile/custom), critical systems (CRM/ERP/payment), data sensitivity (customer PII/financial/health), cloud/on-prem, backup frequency.

D. Security posture (required)

Existing security controls (firewall, EDR, IAM, SIEM), frequency of audits, previous incidents (date & brief), compliance obligations (PCI/GDPR/ISO/HIPAA etc).

E. Pain points & objectives (required)

Free text + picklist tags (downtime, phishing, slow performance, regulatory audit upcoming, migrate to cloud, automation).

F. Business impact estimates (optional but recommended)

Estimated revenue lost per hour of downtime, approximate number of sensitive records.

G. Consents & legal (required)

Explicit checkbox consenting to AI analysis, data retention policy acknowledgement, permission to contact, opt-in for sharing report with third parties.

Design tips:

Use structured picklists + short free text to enable reproducible, auditable inputs.

Keep a versioned copy of every submitted form.

4) Gemini prompt & explainability (conceptual guidance)

Design the prompt so outputs are: (a) concise recommendation, (b) prioritized list, (c) clear evidence mapping, (d) confidence level, (e) actionable next steps.

Prompt behavior requirements (for developer):

Ask Gemini to produce:

A short recommendation summary (max 50 words).

Priority level and numeric risk score (0–100).

Specific facts from the client input the recommendation relies on (fact list).

Explicit assumptions made.

Alternatives and estimated costs/time.

A recommended next human action (e.g., “Schedule VAPT — human review required before engagement”).

Explainability features

Display Gemini’s cited facts and assumptions under Show evidence.

Show a confidence score and a short note when confidence < threshold (e.g., “Low confidence — human review recommended”).

Always include the prompt version and the Gemini model name in the report header (for traceability).

Mitigate hallucinations

Use grounded prompting: prefer extracting/rephrasing client inputs rather than open inference.

When Gemini suggests facts not present in input, mark them as “inferred” and show the basis.

If Gemini’s confidence is low or it uses unsupported assumptions, require human sign-off before sales outreach or contractual proposals.

5) Governance, legal & privacy controls (to minimize disputes & controversy)

You cannot guarantee “0 controversy,” but these controls drastically reduce risks:

Data protection & consent

Explicit consent flow at intake (purpose, retention, sharing).

Encrypt data at rest and in transit (TLS + AES-256).

Role-based access control (RBAC) for admin users.

Data retention policy with automated deletion options and export (user right to be forgotten/export).

Auditability & versioning

Immutable audit log for: submissions, AI prompts, model responses, button clicks, downloads, and changes.

Version number each report; store previous versions for at least the retention window.

Tamper-evident hashes on final PDF proposals (for legal defensibility).

Human-in-the-loop & SLA

Any “critical” recommendation (risk score > threshold) must queue for a human validator before contract/proposal issuance.

Define SLAs for dispute resolution (e.g., 48–72 hours for human review).

Provide a clear escalation path and contact details in the report.

Transparency & disclaimers

Every recommendation must include a concise legal disclaimer: AI-assisted, consultative only, may require further technical audit.

Provide an easy-to-read “How this was decided” panel (the facts and assumptions list).

Bias & fairness

Periodic review of training examples and outputs for systematic bias.

Store anonymized cases for model evaluation and to tune the prompt.

Third-party & API controls

Log every external API call (Gemini, calendar, cloud).

Require API rate limits, input sanitization, and consent before any data is sent to third parties.

Maintain a vendor security checklist for any third-party integrations.

Compliance checklist (minimum)

Consent yes/no recorded; encryption enabled; RBAC; retention rule; audit logs; human review for critical items; clear legal disclaimers; appeals process.

6) UX and display rules to make it non-ignorable — but fair

Top-of-report prominent Risk Score and Top 3 actions (one-line each).

Use clear color coding (red/yellow/green) but pair with exact numbers and explanatory text (avoid fear-only language).

Include evidence CTA next to each high-risk item to let clients verify reasoning.

Keep language plain, avoid jargon.

Include estimated “cost of inaction” numerically where possible.

Accessibility: readable fonts, keyboard navigation, and screen-reader friendly labels.

7) Handling disagreements / disputes

Client clicks Disagree → structured form for reason + optional attachments.

System creates a ticket with the report snapshot; notifies analyst.

Analyst reviews within SLA, can: adjust recommendation, mark explanation as clarified, or escalate to senior with +customer reply.

Provide audit trail of decision and send updated PDF with new version number.

8) Admin features (essential)

View submission list with filters (risk score, status, assigned analyst).

Audit viewer: view prompt, Gemini response, client input snapshot, and button-click logs.

Approve/Reject critical recommendations before proposal generation.

Export case data for compliance or model improvement (anonymized where needed).

Settings: confidence threshold, SLA times, retention periods, RBAC controls.

9) Testing, rollout & monitoring

Start with a staged rollout: internal testing → pilot clients → full launch.

Keep human validator in the loop for first N submissions to build trust and gather edge cases.

Monitor false positives/negatives and track appeals rate; aim to reduce appeals month over month.

Maintain a changelog of prompt versions and model versions.
